        "\n",
        "polymorphism with inheritance is achieved primarily through method overriding and the language's \"duck typing\" philosophy. This allows a single interface (a method with the same name) to be used on objects of different classes, with each object responding in its own specific way.\n",
        "Key concepts\n",
        "Method overriding\n",
        "This is the most direct way to see polymorphism in action with inheritance.\n",
        "A child class (subclass) provides its own specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class (superclass).\n",

        "\n",
        "Method chaining is an object-oriented programming (OOP) technique that allows you to call multiple methods on an object in a single, continuous line of code. This is achieved by having each method return the object itself (self), making the code more readable and concise by eliminating the need for temporary variables to store intermediate results.\n",
        "How it works\n",
        "For method chaining to work in a custom class, each method that is part of the chain must explicitly return the instance of the object (self). This makes the return value of one method an object on which the next method can be called, creating a seamless \"chain\" of operations.\n",
